            <h2>Here are my dreams.</h2>
            <p>
              My dream is to establish a trading company. The reason why a
              trading company is important to me is because I worked for a
              pharmaceutical trading company in Japan. I want my trading company
              to handle more than just medicines. A trading company handles a
              variety of products. This means that I have to travel to many
              different countries and regions. I could do the same job in Japan,
              but I wanted to go there and learn about the products and their
              thoughts there, so I came to Canada, where the environment is
              English-speaking. Working for a trading company requires a lot of
              money, so I would like to work as an engineer to learn about money
              and technology and realise my dream. After I realise my dream, I
              will be satisfied with my life if I can spend my old age freely on
              a southern island.
